This package creates sequences of guide images to feed directly to Panview.


Content:
- bin: Contains the python script (guide_mosaic_sim.py), the C binary that simulates the image and a configuration file for C simulator (sim.params)
- src: Contains the files to compile the C binary (inc. Makefile). There is also a copy of libcfitsio.a, although if it does not match your architecture it will not work and you will have to link yours.


Compilation/Installation:
- To copile the simulate_c.c do make in the src directory. If the link to lincfitsio is set properly, it should work without problems. Once compiled simulate_c at src, you have to copy it to bin/ .
- The python script needs numpy and pyfits (>v3.0) libraries available.


Configuration/Run:
Change the configuration available at the beginning of guide_mosaic_sim.py. The output directory (where the images and other metadata will be generated) must be updated and other values such as sequence length or bias level can be adjusted.
To simulate images with just one star in the middle (for StarFinder testing) you have to set stars_mag_bright and stars_mag_faint to 0.0 (as it is now). For regular distribution of stars in the image, stars_mag_faint used to be 23 and stars_mag_bright 16.
To run the code:
> python guide_mosaic_sim.py


Output:
In the output directory (configured at guide_mosaic_sim.py), N simulated fits images will be generated with 8 extensions each (guider_sim_seqXX.fits), an ascii file per CCD with the position of the stars at the first image of the sequence (stars_ccdX.dat) and an ascii file with the offset applied in each iteration of the sequence (offsets.dat)
